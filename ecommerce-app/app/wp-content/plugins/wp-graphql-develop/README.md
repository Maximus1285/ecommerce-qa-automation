## Shout Outs

- This plugin brings the power of GraphQL (http://graphql.org/) to WordPress.
- The plugin is built on top of the graphql-php library by Webonyx (https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) and makes use 
of the graphql-relay-php library by Ivome (https://github.com/ivome/graphql-relay-php/)
- Special thanks to Gatsby (http://gatsbyjs.com) for allocating development resources to push the project forward.
- Some of the concepts and code are based on the WordPress Rest API. Much love to the folks (https://github.com/orgs/WP-API/people)

platform and helped inspire and direct the development of WPGraphQL.

dev tools (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), and maintaining the JavaScript GraphQL reference

- Much love to Apollo (Meteor Development Group) for their work on driving GraphQL forward and providing a lot of insight 
into how to design GraphQL schemas, etc. Check them out: http://www.apollodata.com/
